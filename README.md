The damages that can be done by fire are devastating. In order to prevent causalities or damages, it is necessary to detect the fire, so that warnings can be provided and even automatic fire suppression systems can be activated. There are multiple ways to detect a fire, like detecting temperature change, smoke detection etc. In all of these detecting temperature change would be more accurate, since some fires won’t even have detectable smoke or even it’s too late. Even the temperature measurement is not too dependable since sometimes it’s too late when the change is detected. To overcome this, we can detect the thermal radiation instead of the temperature variation. The easiest and cheapest way to detect thermal radiation is to use a flame sensor. In this tutorial, we will see how we can interface such a sensor with the Arduino.
